                        <p>The "Breast Cancer Detection" project leverages deep learning techniques and transfer learning to predict
                             breast cancer at an early stage. Through the utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 
                             recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transfer learning with pre-trained models such as VGG, ResNet,
                              and DenseNet, the system extracts meaningful features from medical images like mammograms and 
                              histopathological slides. By fine-tuning pre-trained models and rigorously 
                              evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC, 
                              the project demonstrates the effectiveness of its approach in automating and enhancing breast
                               cancer detection,
                            potentially improving patient outcomes through timely diagnosis and treatment.</p>

                        <p>The "Fake News Classifier" project employs NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to discern
                             between fake and true news articles. Through dataset collection, preprocessing, and feature extraction,
                              textual data is transformed into numerical representations suitable for classification. Various algorithms 
                              such as logistic regression, SVM, random forests, and neural networks are trained and evaluated, with
                               ensemble methods further enhancing classification accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the 
                               effectiveness of the classifier in accurately identifying fake news, 
                            highlighting its potential to combat misinformation and promote media literacy.</p>

                            The "House Price Predictor" project utilizes a real-time dataset to develop a model capable 
                            of predicting house prices accurately. Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model 
                            training, relevant features such as location, size, and amenities are leveraged to make predictions.
                             Machine learning algorithms, including regression techniques and ensemble methods, are explored and 
                             evaluated for their predictive performance. The project aims to provide homebuyers, sellers, and real 
                             estate professionals with a reliable tool 
                            for estimating house prices, facilitating informed decision-making in the real estate market.</p>

                <h3>An Optimized Transfer Learning and Deep Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Automated Breast Cancer Detection</h3>
                <p>One of the most common malignancies in the world is breast cancer, 
                    which primarily affects women, its early detection is important to 
                    diagnose the unwanted cell growth in the breast region. The survival rate increases to 90% when the
                     growth is detected early. The objective of research is to identify different algorithms having a
                      higher accuracy and is faster in detection of the malignant cell growth at the same time to assist
                       doctors to detect the cancerous growth. The research intends to determine whether the existing 
                       Convolutional Neural Network architecture performs the detection accurately or not. In this approach 
                       of detection, we implemented various model architectures such as Deep-CNN, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3,
                        MobileNetV2 on a vast dataset to learn from it. The various models were compared on the basis of
                         their accuracy. VGG16 performed the best in comparison to every other model and came out to be 
                         the best of the implemented, afterwards various optimizers were applied on VGG16 to further 
                         increase the accuracy to find its best tuning parameter. The best accuracy achieved by tuning
                          different optimizers of VGG16 was 97% when the optimizer was set to default, and the default
                           optimizer was “Adam”. 
                    This accuracy over a real-life dataset is considered to be ideal for classification purposes.</p>

                <h3>Computerized Face Mask Detection System Using Deep CNN and Transfer Learning</h3>
                <p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic is on the rise again with hazardous effects in China, 
                    it has become very crucial for global individuals and the authorities to avoid spreading 
                    of the virus. This research aims to identify algorithms with high accuracy and moderate 
                    computing complexity at the same time (although conventional machine learning works on low 
                    computation power, we have rather used CNN for our research work as the accuracy of CNN is 
                    drastically greater than the former), to identify the proper enforcement of face masks. In order
                     to find the best Neural Network architecture we used many deep CNN Methodologies to solve
                      classification problem in regards of masked and non masked image dataset. In this approach
                       we applied different model architectures, like VGG16, Resnet50, Resnet101 and VGG19, on a
                        large dataset to train on and compared the model on the basis of accuracy in which VGG16 
                        came out to be the best. VGG16 was further tuned with different optimizers to determine the 
                        one best fit of the model.
                     VGG16 gave an ideal accuracy of 99.37% with the best fit optimizer over a real life data set.</p>
